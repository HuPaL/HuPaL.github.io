						<h3>Historically, the major players in the FX market were large central banks, multinational firms and big financial institutions.</h3>

					<h3 class="spoiler-title">Advantages of Trading Forex</h3>
					<div class="spoiler-body">
					<h4>1.  Liquidity</h4>
					<p>The FX market has huge appeal for the retail trader as it is an extremely liquid market. A liquid market means that there are a huge number of buyers and sellers resulting in swift trade execution – both buying and selling – at any time within market hours.</p>

					<h4>2.  Continuous Operation</h4>
					<p>The FX market is open 24 hours a day, 5 days a week meaning we can open and close trades at any hour of the day unlike other markets e.g. commodities and stocks. The highest volume of trading usually takes place as the various global markets open throughout the day – starting in Sydney, then Tokyo, then London and finishing in New York.</p>

					<h4>3.  Leverage</h4>
					<p>Due to the high level of liquidity in the FX market most brokers will offer a higher leverage than other markets. We will discuss this in greater depth later. The basic concept is that a trader only requires a small percentage of the overall price of the position. For example, if we had leverage of 200:1 and have $500 to invest, we could take a position of $100,000.</p>
					<p>Therefore smaller movements in the price of a currency have greater weight which can lead to greater gains on smaller investments. However, leverage does work both ways and can magnify losses.</p>

					<h4>4.   Low Entry Level</h4>
					<p>Due to the high level of leverage it is possible to open accounts with FX brokers from as low as $100. This is a much lower entry level than other types of investments.</p>

					<h4>5.   Low Transaction Costs</h4>
					<p>An FX broker mainly generates their revenue from the difference between the buy and sell prices. This is called the spread and due to the high trading volumes it is quite a small fee when compared to the fees charged by a traditional stock broker for example.</p>

					<h4>6.  No Market Manipulation</h4>
					<p>It is impossible for one big player to corner or manipulate the FX market due to its size. Unlike other, smaller markets where a large institution may be able to affect the price by placing a big order, the FX market is so big this will not have a major impact. Government decisions, policies and reports, along with other global news stories are the most likely cause for large movements</p>

					<h3 class="spoiler-title">Participation in the Forex Market</h3>
					<div class="spoiler-body">	
						<p>Many of us will have participated in the FX market before if we have ever travelled to a country that has a different currency to our own. We have all seen the foreign exchange booths where different exchange rates are listed on a digital screen.</p>
						<p>As an example, assume we are going on a holiday from the United Kingdom to the US and we see that the exchange rate on offer is 1 Pound for $1.50. This is the equivalent of $1 equaling approximately 67 pence.</p>
						<p>We decide to exchange £1,000 for $1,500 dollars.</p>
						<p>Now assume we didn’t spend all of our $1,500 dollars and return to the United Kingdom with $500 dollars one week later. The exchange rate has changed and now £1 equals $1 dollar 25 cent. This is the equivalent of $1 dollar equaling 80 pence.</p>
						<p>This means that the dollar strengthened against the pound over that period of time. So we exchange our $500 dollars back to sterling at a rate of $1 dollar for 80 pence and get back £400 pound. We get more pounds for our dollars.</p>
						<p>By default we have just made a profit in the FX Market.</p>

					<h3 class="spoiler-title">What is Traded?</h3>
					<div class="spoiler-body">
					<p>A country’s currency is a direct reflection of what the market thinks about the current and future health of its economy. A recessionary, stagnant economy will result in a weak currency, while a surging, growing economy will result in a strong currency. We are therefore speculating on the strength and weaknesses of one economy or country against another.</p>

					<h3 class="spoiler-title">Major & Minor Currencies</h3>
					<div class="spoiler-body">
					<p>When trading FX, currencies are abbreviated into three letter symbols. For example the euro is the EUR, the US Dollar is the USD, the Japanese Yen is the JPY, the UK pound is the GBP and so on. Currencies are generally split into two categories – the major currencies and the minor currencies.</p>
					<p>As you would guess the majors are the currencies of the major global economies – the US, Japan, UK, Euro Zone, Canada, Australia, Switzerland and New Zealand.
</p>
					<p>A noticeable absentee is the Chinese Yuan as the Chinese government restricts trading of its currency. The majors are by far the most frequently traded currencies and make up around 90% of the FX market.
</p>
					<p>Minor or exotic currencies are so-called as they are the currencies of less prominent or emerging economies such as the Hong Kong Dollar, Mexican Peso, Swedish Krona, Hungarian Forint and so on. They are traded in smaller quantities when compared to the majors and often the cost of trade is much higher due to their illiquidity.</p>
					<p>Forex trading is essentially the buying of one currency and the simultaneous selling of another. Therefore when trading currencies we will always see them quoted in pairs.
</p>
					<p>When placing a trade we are speculating on which currency we believe will become stronger or weaker against the other with the goal of making a profit from the exchange rate movement.
</p>
					<p>The currency to the left is called the base currency. The currency to the right is called the quote the currency. The quote currency tells us how much it is worth against 1 unit of the base currency. So if we say the EURUSD is trading at 1.3000 it means 1 euro equals $1.30.
</p>
					<p>The base currency is the basis for the buy or the sell trade. If we believe that the Euro will strengthen against the dollar we would buy the EURUSD pair. This means we are buying the base currency – the EURO, and simultaneously selling the quote currency – the US DOLLAR.</p>
					<p>If we believe the EURO will weaken against the US Dollar we will sell the pair i.e. we are selling EURO and simultaneously buying US DOLLARS.</p>
					<p>When we are buying the base currency, in traders jargon we call this going long (looking to profit from the pair rising), and when we are selling the base currency we call this going short (looking to profit from the currency pair falling).</p>

					<h3 class="spoiler-title">Reading an FX Quote</h3>
					<div class="spoiler-body">
					<p>As we have already said, when a currency is quoted it is paired with another currency. So the value of one is reflected through the value of another. The base currency is to the left of the pair and the quote currency is to the right.</p>
					<p>Let’s look at an example</p>
					
					<div class="gbp-jpy">
						<p>GBP/JPY = 149.500</p>
					</div>

					<p>In this case the Pound Sterling is the base currency and the Japanese Yen is the quote currency. Therefore: £ 1 = ¥ 149.50</p>
					<p>However when we are trading financial instruments such as currencies we are offered two slightly different prices.</p>
					<p>We have the sell price (also known as the bid price) and the buy price (also known as the ask price).</p>
					<p>The bid price is the best available price at which we can sell to the market.</p>

					<p>The ask price is the best available price at which we can buy from the market.</p>

					<p>The difference between the two prices is what we call the spread and this is how our broker generates revenue. It is the cost of placing a trade.</p>

					<p>In this case we can see the EURUSD has a bid price of 1.31819 and an ask price of 1.31849. The difference between the two is 0.0003 or what we call three pips. In our next article we will discuss the calculation and importance of understanding pips and pip values.
</p>

					<p>A pip is the unit of measurement to express the change in price between two currencies.</p>

					<p>Just like a pip is the smallest part of a fruit, a pip in forex refers to the smallest price unit related to a currency. The term ‘pip’ is actually an acronym for ‘percentage in point’.</p>
					<p>Professional forex traders often express their gains and losses in the number of pips their position rose or fell.</p>
					<p>For example, if the EUR/USD moves from 1.2712 to 1.2713, that 0.0001 rise in the exchange rate is ONE PIP.</p>
					<p>All major currency pairs go to the fourth decimal place to quantify a pip apart from the Japanese Yen which only goes to two.</p>
					<p>Some brokers only quote to the fourth and second decimal place (for JPY pairs) but others quote to the fifth decimal place of the currency to provide even greater accuracy when measuring gains and losses. This fifth decimal place is what we call a pipette – one tenth of a pip.</p>
					<p>So for example if the EURUSD moves from 1.27128 to 1.27 129, we can say it has moved one pipette or 0.1 pips (1 tenth of a pip).</p>

					<h3 class="spoiler-title">Calculating the value of 1 PIP movement</h3>
					<div class="spoiler-body">
					<p>So now that we know what a pip is, what does it mean to us in terms of how much money we make or lose for each movement?</p>
					<p>Well this depends on the size of the position we opened. Larger positions mean each pip movement in the pair will have greater monetary consequence to our balance.</p>
					<p>To calculate this it is quite simple. We simply multiply our position size by 0.0001 (i.e. ONE PIP):</p>
					<p>Let’s take an example and stick with our EURUSD pair. We can forget what price it is trading at for now and we’ll concentrate on how much money a pip move will be for various position sizes.</p>
					<p>So say we wanted to open a position size of 10,000 units.</p>
					<p>Our calculation to establish what a one pip movement means to us is as follows:</p>
					<p class="p-bold">10,000 (units) * 0.0001 (one pip) = $ 1 per pip</p>
					<p>So a position of 10,000 (BUY or SELL) means that every time the pair moves 0.0001 (i.e. ONE PIP) then we will make a profit or loss of $1.00 depending on which way it moved.</p>
					<p>Therefore, for a position of this size – 10,000 units – we will gain or lose $1 for every pip movement in either direction. So if the EUR/USD moves 100 pips (i.e. 1 cent) in our direction we will make $100 profit.</p>
					<p>We can do this for any trade size. The calculation is simply the trade size times 0.0001 (1 pip).</p>

					<p class="p-bold">5,000 (units) * 0.0001 (one pip) = $ 0.50 per pip</p>
					<p class="p-bold">60,000 (units) * 0.0001 (one pip) = $ 6 per pip</p>
					<p class="p-bold">123,000 (units) * 0.0001 (one pip) = $ 12.30 per pip</p>

					<p>Our pip value WILL ALWAYS BE MEASURED IN THE CURRENCY OF THE QUOTE CURRENCY OF THE FX PAIR i.e. the currency on the right-hand size of the pair.
</p>
					<p>So in the example of the EURUSD we see our pip value is always in US Dollars.</p>
					<p>If we were trading the EURGBP pair, the pip value will be in Pound Sterling.</p>
					<p>So…</p>
					<p>10,000 units * 0.0001 = £ 1.00 per pip</p>
					<p>Therefore the final calculation we must consider is if we have a trading account in a different currency denomination, as brokers offer accounts in US Dollar, Euro, Pound and Yen.</p>
					<p>So let’s say we have a Euro platform taking our EURGBP example above and the current EURGBP exchange rate is 1.5000.</p>
					<p>Then each pip movement of 1.00 would be automatically converted by our broker to – we simply divide 1$ by the current EURUSD rate which is 1.26500 which equals 0.79c.</p>
					<p>If we are using a GBP platform one pip will equal 1$/1.59500 (the GBPUSD rate) or 0.63 pence.</p>
					<p>These calculations will be done automatically on our trading platform but it is important to know how they are worked out.</p>
					<p>At this point you may be asking ‘how can I trade such large positions such as 10,000 units of a currency pair? That sounds like a very large investment!’ The answer to that question is leverage which we will discuss in another article.</p>
					<p>Historically, currencies were traded in specific amounts called lots. The standard size for a lot is 100,000 units. There are also mini-lots of 10,000 and micro-lots of 1,000.</p>
					<p>To take advantage of relatively small moves in the exchange rates of currency, we need to trade large amounts in order to see any significant profit (or loss).</p>

				<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
					<p>As we have already discussed in our previous article, currency movements are measured in pips and depending on our lot size a pip movement will have a different monetary value.</p>
					<p>So looking at an order window below we see that we have chosen to BUY a mini-lot of 10,000 units of the EURUSD.</p>
					<p>So what we are effectively doing is buying €10,000 worth of US Dollars at the exchange rate 1.35917. We are looking for the exchange rate to rise (i.e. the Euro to strengthen against the US Dollar) so we can close out our position for a profit.</p>
					<p>So let’s say the exchange rate moves from 1.35917 to 1.36917 –the exchange rate rose by 1c ($). This is the equivalent of 100 pips.</p>
					<p>So with a lot size 10,000, each pip movement is $1.00 profit or loss to us (10,000* 0.0001 = $1.00).</p>
					<p>As it moved upwards by 100 pips we made a profit of $100.</p>
					<p>For example’s sake, if we opened a lot size for 100,000 units we would have made a profit of $1,000.</p>
					<p>Therefore lot sizes are crucial in determining how much of a profit (or loss) we make on the exchange rate movements of currency pairs.</p>
					<p>We do not have to restrict ourselves to the historical specific amounts of standard, mini and micro. We can enter any amount we wish greater than 1,000 units. 1,000 units is the minimum position size we can open.</p>
					<p>So for example, we can sell 28,000 units of the GBPJPY currency pair at the rate of 156.016. Each pip movement is ¥ 280 (28,000 * 0.01). We then take our ¥ 280 per pip and change it to the base currency of our account which of course our broker does automatically.</p>

					<div class="gbp-jpy">
						<p>¥ 280 =€2.12 per pip at a EURJPY exchange rate of 132.00</p>
					</div>
					<p>So with a Euro denominated account a fall of 50 pips to 155.516 would mean a profit of 106.00 (50* 2.12).</p>

				<h3 class="spoiler-title">What is Leverage & Margin?</h3>
				<div class="spoiler-body">
				<p>Trading with leverage allows traders to enter markets that would be otherwise restricted based on their account size. Leverage allows traders to open positions for more lots, more contracts, more shares etc. than they would otherwise be able to afford.</p>
				<p>Let’s consider our broker a bank that will front us $100,000 to buy or sell a currency pair. To gain access to these funds they ask us to put down a good faith deposit of say $500 which they will hold but not necessarily keep. This is what we call our margin. For each position and instrument we open our broker will specify a required margin indicated as a percentage. Margin can therefore be considered a form of collateral for the short-term loan we take from our broker along with the actual instrument itself.</p>
				<p>For example, when trading FX pairs the margin may be 0.5% of the position size traded or 200:1 leverage. Other platforms and brokers may only require 0.25% margin or 400:1 leverage.</p>
				<p>The margin requirement is always measured in the base currency i.e. the currency on the left of the FX pair.</p>
				<p>Let’s look at an example. Say we are using a dollar platform and we wanted to buy a micro lot (1,000 units) of the EUR/GBP pair and our broker was offering us 200:1 leverage or 0.5% required margin.</p>
				<p>Our broker will therefore take just €5 as margin and we were able to buy 1,000 units of the EUR/GBP pair. If we were using a US Dollar platform that €5 is automatically converted to dollars by our broker at the current exchange rate for the EUR/USD.</p>

					<h3 class="spoiler-title">Overnight Premiums/Swaps</h3>
					<div class="spoiler-body">
					<p>When an FX position (or a CFD position) is held overnight (or ‘rolled over’) there is a charge known as a ‘swap’ or ‘overnight premium’. We call it a charge; however it is possible to earn a positive sum each night too. When trading FX, it is based on the interest rates of the currencies we are buying and selling.</p>
					<p>So for example, if we were buying the AUD/CHF we would earn a positive overnight sum as we would earn interest on the Australian Dollars we bought as the Australian interest rate is higher than the Swiss interest rate (in fact the Swiss interest rate is zero). So often buying currencies against the Swiss Franc will result in a positive swap.</p>
					<p>For the most part however an overnight premium will be a charge on our account and again this relates to the size of our position. The actual percentage is very small each night as it is the annual interest rate divided by 360 (days in year). Our broker automatically calculates overnight premiums and they usually take effect after 10pm GMT.</p>

				<p>Above are examples of various swap rates for a sample of FX pairs. We can see that the overnight premium can be positive or negative and depends on whether we are buying or selling the pair. It is important to review the premiums if we plan to leave positions open overnight as it will affect the profit or loss of our position. All brokers should outline their overnight rates under their trading conditions.</p>
