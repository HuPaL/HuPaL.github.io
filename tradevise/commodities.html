					<h3>Gold</h3>
					
					<p>Gold is a precious metal and malleable in nature. Historically, it has been a very valuable metal due to its precious nature and used as a medium of exchange or as currency.</p>
					
					<p>Gold is popularly used in the making of jewelry. What more, gold is also very useful in industrial application. As it is a good conductor, very malleable and highly ductile, it is used in electronics, typically as wiring.</p>
					
					<p>Most electronic devices which we use contain elements of gold in their components including mobile phones, televisions, GPS systems, calculators, and computers.</p>
					
					<p>Other notable uses include glassmaking, medical treatments and dentistry. It’s important for you to know that gold is viewed as a safe-haven investment in the face of slowing global economies and recession.</p>
					
					<p>Other precious metals notably silver, platinum and palladium provide alternatives to gold, given the high price of gold. These other metals are able to provide some of the physical properties of gold at a lower price.</p>

					<h3>Supply & Demand & the Factors Affecting Price</h3>
					
					<p>The largest gold producing nation in the world is China. Other notable producers are Australia, the US, Russia, South Africa, Canada, Ghana, Indonesia, and Uzbekistan. The largest importing nation of the precious metal is India, with their main use being for jewelry.</p>
					
					<p>In terms of the fundamental factors which affect gold prices, there are a number of things to consider. Gold prices may react differently depending on different economies and this in turn stems from the different uses of gold from different nations and regions of the world.</p>
					
					<p>When looking at gold prices, it is important to look at the dollar. They share an inverse correlation with each other, so if the dollar were to increase in value, gold would likely decrease in value as a result and vice versa.</p>
					
					<p>You may see increases in gold prices in times of recession and at times of economic prosperity.</p>
					
					<p>At times of economic recession, there may be an increase in demand for gold as a hedging tool against inflation or against currency devaluation.</p>
					
					<p>However, there may be increases in demand for gold when an economy is experiencing growth as there may be more consumers with the disposable income to purchase luxury goods, notably jewelry. In terms of the movement of gold, it’s use as a means of hedging.</p>
					
					<p>These fundamental factors need to be weighed up in order to paint the best picture for you on how to trade gold.</p>

					<h3>Silver</h3>
					
					<p>Silver is a white metal. Like gold, it is also a precious metal. As well as its popularity in the creation of jewelry, silver has a number of industrial applications and uses in consumer goods.</p>
					
					<p>Silver is the best electrical and thermo-conductors amongst all metals, making It so useful in electrical connections in a wide range of electronic appliances usually as a membrane switch. Silver also has medical uses as a disinfectant. As mentioned earlier, silver is a notable substitute metal for gold, as it carries some of the same properties as gold, yet is less expensive. It is important for you to keep this in mind when looking at all the other metals.</p>
					
					<p>Supply & Demand & the Factors Affecting Price</p>
					
					<p>The major silver producing nations of the world include, Mexico, Peru, China, Australia, Chile, Russia, Poland, as well as the US and Bolivia. China is one of the world’s largest importers of the precious metal in the world, which has seen an increase with the massive growth in their economy.</p>
					
					<p>One of the reasons for their silver imports is for investment purposes. Like gold, India is a very prominent importer of silver or the purpose of jewelry making.</p>
					
					<p>These are some of the major players for you to keep an eye on in light of the silver markets with supply and demand side factors which may impact upon producers and the consumers respectively.</p>

					<h3>Usage of Silver</h3>
					
					<p>As silver has a wider use for industrial purposes, the price of silver is affected by changes in economic circumstances, with a strengthening economy leading to increased demand for manufacturing, which in turn may lead to increased volatility for the metal when compared with Gold.</p>
					
					<p>Be aware that gold and silver are finite resources, meaning that they should always be in demand and could be even more expensive in future as reserves of each of these are further depleted. Along with this, an important consideration regarding the gold and silver prices is in the scrap market.</p>
					
					<p>Unlike soft commodities and grains, metals, gold and silver can be reused, so supply of gold does not hinge entirely on that which is freshly mined from the ground. This scrap metal trade may impact upon their respective markets and potentially even more so than that which is mined.</p>

					<h3>Things to Take Away</h3>
					
					<p>When trading gold and silver, you must be aware of what they are both used for the major producing and exporting nations, as well as the big consumers and importers.</p>
					
					<p>It is vital to know about the use of these precious metals not only for industrial usage but for hedging purposes against factors such inflation and the strength of currency.</p>
					
					<p>The trade in scrap metals is a vital factor for you to be aware of in the market for gold and silver.</p>

					<h3>Platinum></h3>
					
					<p>Platinum is a precious metal and is used in a number of functions and processes. Platinum is used as a catalytic converter on motorized vehicles, and a catalyst for nitric acid production used in the production of fertilizers and explosives. A number of economies favor the consumption of platinum for the purpose of making jewelry, given the increased popularity of white metal jewelry in the US and also emerging markets. It is also seen as a good investment market. Platinum is otherwise known as high octane gold.</p>
					
					<p>There is considerably less platinum available in the market than gold, which is an important factor which may have an important implication on supply for you to consider.</p>
					
					<p>Given the great amount of uses for platinum and its comparative rarity to gold, the platinum market tends to trade at a higher price that gold. Due to its value as a scarce precious metal the price movements in platinum can be strong and like gold, and it is felt that it is a market which could sustain a bullish trend moving forward.</p>
					
					<p>A key factor to watch is the automobile industry as around half of the world’s platinum is used here. Given platinum’s use in this industry, a growth in the economy that leads to expansion of the automotive industry will have a big effect on the platinum market.</p>

					 <h3>Palladium</h3>
					
				    <p>Palladium is a precious white metal which forms part of the platinum group metals. Due to its high resistance to oxidization, it is known as a ‘noble metal’.</p>
					
					<p>Palladium is used in a number of functions. Like platinum, it is used in the production of catalytic converters on cars and other motorized vehicles, converting toxic emissions into more environmentally friendly emissions.</p>
					
					<p>They are also used in the production of jewelry, especially as an alloy in the creation of white gold. Nickel, which was previously the alloy of choice for this purpose, was banned by the European Union in 2000, due to health concerns. Palladium is also increasingly being utilized within electronic circuitry.</p>
					
					<p>Supply & Demand & the Factors Affecting Price</p>
					
					<p>Like platinum the biggest players in mining this are Russia and South Africa. Two major factors to palladium demand to be aware of are that of the jewelry and automotive industry.</p>
					
					<p>In the Platinum group metals, namely platinum and palladium, the main source of fundamental data reports are released by a Johnson Matthey. They are a specialist chemical company with expertise in the platinum group metals.</p>
					
					<p>They provide a bi-annual report which provides a review of supply and demand for these metals. It’s important for you to be aware that given the limited number of palladium producing nations in the world, the market can be somewhat volatile, much like the platinum market.</p>

					 <h3>Copper</h3>
					
					<p>Copper is a non-ferrous, soft metal, known for its malleability and is a very strong conductor. It is a base metal, i.e. is a metal of which there is a greater abundance of and doesn’t have the same value attached to it as one of the precious metals.</p>
					
					<p>Copper is the third most popularly used metal in the world, behind aluminum and steel. Its strength together with its other attributes previously mentioned, renders copper as the conductor wire of choice in construction. Copper also plays a very important part in solar panels, as a cleaner energy source means more demand for copper.</p>
					
					<p>Supply & Demand & The Factors Affecting Price</p>
					
					<p>The nation which produces the most amount of copper is Chile. Copper from the nation constitutes around one third of the world’s mined copper. Other prominent copper producing nations are the US, Australia, China, Peru and Indonesia.</p>
					
					<p>China is the world’s largest consumer and importer of copper in the world. With this in mind, it is important to know about the state of the Chinese economy which may in turn impact upon Chinese demand for this popular base metal. Looking at Chinese export sales figures can provide a good indication of this.</p>
					
					<p>The US is also a major importer of copper, with half of the imports originating from Chile. Knowing this, one of the best releases which provides fundamental data on copper can be gathered from New Residential Construction Report also known as Housing Starts, released by the US Census Bureau, monthly around the 17th day of each month.</p>
					
					<p>It is a main component in construction (electrical wiring and plumbing) so if we see a decrease in unemployment, the implication is that more houses are being built we would see a rise in copper prices.</p>
					
					<p>Be aware that like gold and silver, Platinum, Palladium and Copper are finite resources, meaning that they should always be in demand and could possibly be very profitable in years to come when reserves of each of these become scarce.</p>

					 <h3>Things to Take Away</h3>
					
					<p>There are a number of things you should now be aware of with these metals. You need to be aware of the key fundamental drivers in these markets.</p>
					
					<p>You need to know the major mining nations, which are important in light of supply.</p>
					
					<p>It is also important for you to be aware of consuming nations and the industries where they are predominantly used, which in turn will affect demand.</p>
					
					<p>You need to stay abreast of any breaking news reports or data releases which will impact upon their fundamentals.</p>
					
					<p>With this, you will provide yourself with the best background to trade the market.</p>
					
					<p>So when we talk of oil, what exactly do we mean?</p>
					
					<p>Crude oil is formed when the remains of plants and animals are covered in sand and other organic matter, and over millions of years the pressure causes them to turn into sedimentary rock and eventually oil.</p>
					
					<p>Due to the fact that the oil is formed deep underground (either on land or under the sea), the extraction process involves digging deep into oil reserves, through layers of rock, and it is therefore very costly to extract and produce.</p>
				</div>

		<div class="container">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
					 <h3>Extraction</h3>
					
					<p>This cost of extraction is consequently factored into oil market prices, with an increased cost of production inevitably leading to an increase in oil prices. </p>
					
					<p>Even more significant than the cost of extraction is the fact that there is only a limited availability of oil available anywhere in the world. Oil is found in only a handful of countries, the most significant of which are the 12 OPEC countries (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries), and together these 12 countries account for over 75% of all proven oil reserves in the world.</p>
					
					<p>The most significant OPEC members include Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Venezuela and Nigeria.</p>
					
					<p>As a trader we therefore need to constantly monitor levels of production, exportation levels, and any disruption that may occur in major oil exporting countries. Any increase or decrease in production will impact prices.</p>
					
					<p>When calculating oil prices a huge consideration is the fact that oil is a finite resource which will one day run out. As supplies dwindle, or become harder to extract, prices will increase. The long term price trend for oil is therefore very much predictable.</p>

					<h3>Types of Oil Traded</h3>
					
					<p>When we talk of trading oil, the oils we generally mean are WTI, which is short for West Texas Intermediate oil (also known as Crude Oil) and Brent Crude Oil, often referred to as Brent.</p>
					
					<p>WTI is produced in the USA and Brent is produced in the North Sea. Both are high quality oils, and this means that once they have been extracted from the ground they can be refined to make it usable for lots of different purposes.</p>
					
					<p>Uses include refining into petrol to power a car, as fuel in the generation of electricity and heating, and also to create plastics, petrochemicals and many other products. This therefore means that both WTI and Brent are constantly in very high demand around the world, and are consequently highly correlated.</p>

					<h3>Major Consuming Nations</h3>
					
					<p>Globally the largest consumers of oil are developed industrial countries such as the United States, and European countries. However over the last two decades there has been a huge growth in consumption in the Far East, with China in particular now a major user.</p>
					
					<p>The largest oil consumer nations include US, Japan, China, Germany, and the UK so when trading oil we always need to keep an eye on the major consuming nations to monitor whether their usage is increasing or decreasing.</p>
					
					<p>An increase in demand will tend to mean an increase in prices, and similarly a decrease in demand will tend to mean a decrease in prices (provided that supply levels remain consistent).</p>

					<h3>Volatility & Potential Opportunities</h3>
					
					<p>The fact that oil has so many uses means that it is one of the most traded and volatile markets in the world.</p>
					
					<p>For traders this presents huge opportunities, but when trading oil we need to pay particular attention to a wide range of supply and demand issues which can potentially have a huge impact on prices, often in a very short timeframe.</p>
					
					<p>A famous example of this is when oil rose to a record high of $145 in June 2008, only to then fall to around $30 by December of the same year.</p>

				<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
					 <p>The record high prices were caused by a combination of factors, most notably supply disruptions in Nigeria due to political factors, combined with the belief that increased demand from developing nations such as China and India would outstrip supply.</p>
					
					<p>However, within only a matter of months these fears were dismissed by the markets, leading to a huge $110 price swing, down to roughly $30 and this presented a great opportunity for traders of all timeframes.</p>

					  <h3>Key Reports</h3>
					
					<p>There are two specific oil reports that oil traders must be aware of. The first of these is the weekly Department of Energy (DOE) Oil Inventory. This is released every Wednesday and quantifies how much oil stock is left in storage, for use in America (the largest consumer).</p>
					
					<p>If inventory figures increase it implies that there has been less demand than previous weeks, and hence prices should fall. If inventory figures decrease it implies that there has been higher usage, and prices should therefore increase.</p>
					
					<p>Another key report we pay attention to are the periodic OPEC reports, in which they outline production quotas for member states, thereby determining how much supply will be made available to world markets.</p>
					
					<p>Their production quotas depend upon levels of world supply and demand – if demand is high or supply is low OPEC will increase production, thereby lowering prices. However if demand is low or supply is high, production levels will be cut.</p>
					
					<p>The power that OPEC has in determining prices should therefore not be underestimated, and many people complain that the fact that countries eager to make as much profit as possible are responsible for determining supply levels is a potentially dangerous thing. This is one of the reasons why in recent years there has been a big push towards alternative fuel sources.</p>
					
					<p>Another factor to be aware of when trading oil is that although oil is in high demand throughout the year, was tend to notice two seasonal periods where demand is larger than normal. These are the winter months, where oil is used as a heat source and during the summer months (known as the driving season) where there is an increase in petrol consumption due to families in America and Europe going on holiday.</p>

					 <h3>Things to Take Away</h3>
					
					<p>Crude oil is a finite resource, and the vast majority of world reserves are to be found in OPEC nations</p>
					
					<p>WTI and Brent are two of the most traded markets in the world</p>
					
					<p>Prices are determined by supply and demand factors which may range from seasonal factors and political factors, to economic factors and consumption from developing nations</p>
					
					<p>Key reports oil traders must consider include the DOE oil inventories, and OPEC reports</p>
					
					<p>In this article we will be discussing various energy commodities, namely natural gas, heating oil and gasoline. Natural gas and heating oil can both be categorized as distillate energies, or distillates, whereas natural gas is a commodity extracted by drilling for gas deposits often found alongside crude oil reserves.</p>

					  <h3>What are Energies?</h3>
					
					<p>The term energy, when related to trading is a broad term used to describe commodities which can be used as a means of power.</p>

					<h3>What are Distillates?</h3>
					
					<p>Heating oil and gasoline both derive from distillation, which is the process by which crude oil is heated, and the resulting gasses are cooled at specific temperatures. The temperature at which the gasses are cooled will determine which form of energy is produced.</p>
					
					<p>This differs from natural gas, which does not need any distillation and is found naturally underground. It is important to note that all of these resources are finite, and will one day run out.</p>

					 <h3>Heating Oil</h3>
					
					<p>Heating oil and gasoline both derive from distillation, which is the process by which crude oil is heated, and the resulting gasses are cooled at specific temperatures. The temperature at which the gasses are cooled will determine which form of energy is produced.</p>
					
					<p>This differs from natural gas, which does not need any distillation and is found naturally underground. It is important to note that all of these resources are finite, and will one day run out.</p>

					<h3>Natural Gas</h3>
					
					<p>Natural gas by comparison is the most commonly used form of heating energy, and is connected to most households directly via pipelines. After it is extracted from the ground, the natural gas must be treated in order to separate it into liquids and gasses suitable for transporting around the world (as liquid), and domestically in pipelines.</p>
					
					<p>It must then be processed in specialist plants to ensure it meets quality specifications. This is an extremely complex and expensive process, and any disruption to the processing will impact upon prices. Natural gas also has other uses besides heating and these include the generation of electricity and cook food via gas ovens.</p>
					
					<p>This means that whereas heating oil will have strong seasonal demand, natural gas will be required consistently throughout the year. It is estimated that up to 25% of American energy consumption comes from natural gas.</p>

					<h3>Gasoline</h3>
					
					<p>Gasoline, also known as petrol, is similar to heating oil in that it is also a by-product of crude oil but is primarily used to power machinery, most notably cars. Gasoline is consumed across the world. It is important to note that there are other distillate markets besides heating oil and gasoline, and these include kerosene, jet oil and diesel, amongst others.</p>
					
					<p>Although these markets are far smaller than gasoline and heating oil, as traders we must also monitor these when trading distillates as they have a very close correlation to one and other.</p>

					<h3>Supply and Demand Factors</h3>

					<p>When trading energies we have to remember that prices for heating oil, gasoline, and natural gas are determined by supply and demand factors, and are intrinsically linked to crude oil prices.</p>
					
					<p>The two main distillate energies have a much correlated relationship because the more of one energy that is produced, the less supply there will be of another. This is because if more crude oil is being used to produce gasoline for instance, less crude oil is available to be used for heating oil. This fall in supply should therefore lead to an increase of heating oil prices.</p>

                    <p>The inverse is also true. If less of one distillate is produced, more is likely to be produced of others. An example can be seen in 2001 in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks. Because airports were shut, and demand for energies to power the planes fell, distillers decided to distil less jet fuel, and switch to heating oil instead.</p>

                    <p>This leads to a sudden increase in supply, and a consequent fall in heating oil price. This goes to show that not only are all distillate energies closely related, but they will also have a very close correlation with crude oil prices.</p>

                    <h3>Seasonal Demand</h3>
					
					<p>Another factor to consider when trading distillates is seasonal demand. Due to the fact that heating oil is used primarily for heating fuel, it is an incredibly seasonal market and prices are largely dependent upon winter weather.</p>
					
					<p>In particularly severe or cold winters, demand increases, and consequently prices rise. However warmer winters will lead to reduced demand, and lower prices. As such, heating oil traders will pay close attention to weather patterns in order to ascertain potential usage.</p>
					
					<p>Although natural gas is also used as heating fuel, the seasonality of natural gas differs. This is because the demand spikes in the winter when heating is required, but it also rises again in summer months when there is an increase in electrical usage, particularly in the USA, due to air conditioning usage.</p>

	<section class="forex-two">
		<div class="container">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
					<p>Gasoline is also a seasonal market, but it contrasts significantly from the heating oil and natural gas seasons. During the winter when heating oil demand rises, gasoline demand tends to fall. The cold weather tends to discourage people from making long car journeys, therefore needing less petrol.</p>
					
					<p>However, in the summer, when heating oil demand falls, gasoline demand increases due to increased car usage. This inverse correlation is one that all energies traders should be aware of.</p>
					
					<p>Heating oil and gasoline will all be influenced in price by supply and demand factors affecting crude oil. If OPEC announced a production cut, this would mean less crude oil would be available to distil into heating oil or gasoline.</p>
					
					<p>For this reason, distillate prices closely follow crude oil prices and if you are trading distillates you should also be aware of factors which will affect oil prices.</p>
					
					<p>Gasoline tends to be the most expensive of the distilled energies as not only does it cost more to distil and produce but it also has the highest global demand.</p>

					<h3>Key Reports</h3>
					
					<p>As traders the most important supply and demand data for heating oil and gasoline are released alongside crude oil data every Wednesday in the DOE inventories. This is a major market moving economic release as it reveals the stock piles of crude oil, and also other distillate energies.</p>

                    <p>In a similar fashion to oil, any increase in stockpiles for heating oil or gasoline would lead to a fall in market prices as it indicates a reduction in consumption or an increase in supply. However, a decrease in stockpiles should lead to a rise in prices as it will indicate higher usage or lower supply.</p>

                    <p>The key supply and demand data for natural gas comes from weekly DOE Natural Gas Storage Reports, released every Thursday. This details the net change in storage levels of natural gas, and this is broken down into three regions – Eastern/Mid-Western areas (the key consumers), the South (which are the main producers), and the West.</p>

                    <p>Gasoline and heating oil are by-products of crude oil, formed in the distillation process.</p>

                    <p>Natural gas is not a by-product of crude oil, but is commonly found alongside oil reserves.</p>

                    <p>Both natural gas and distillates are seasonal markets and they are closely correlated to crude oil prices. As such prices will be influenced by supply and demand factors influencing crude oil prices.</p>

                    <p>There is a close correlation amongst all distillate prices as the more demand that there is for one distillate, the less supply there will be for others.</p>

                    <p>The key fundamental releases are the weekly DOE inventory figures on Wednesdays and Thursdays which reveals stockpile levels for the distillates and separately for natural gas.</p>

					<h3>Coffee</h3>
					
					<p>Coffee is one of the most prominent soft commodities. There are two main types of coffee crop which are traded and consumed, Arabica and Robusta.</p>

                    <p>The market for Arabica is the larger of these two species. Coffee is almost exclusively used for human consumption.</p>

                    <p>Coffee is one of the most popular hot drinks in the world.</p>

          <h3>Major Producers, Importers & Exporters</h3>
					
					<p>The largest producer of coffee is Brazil, who account for over one third of the world’s coffee production. Other notable producers of coffee are Vietnam and also Colombia. These major producers all share something in common in that they are all based in tropical and subtropical climates, where the crop tends to flourish. They are also developing nations.</p>

                    <p>Brazil is the major producer of Arabica and also one of the most prominent producers of Robusta too. Given the dominance of coffee production in Brazil, the coffee market is very sensitive to factors which impact upon supply from Brazil. Their importance in the coffee market should not be overlooked.</p>

                    <p>Vietnam is a growing power in international coffee trade, being the number one Robusta producer. Technological advanced made by some of the leading coffee manufacturers means that the cheaper, poorer quality Robusta coffee can now be manufactured to produce a less harsh tasting coffee product for the consumer.</p>

                    <p>Given its low prices compared with the finer Arabica coffee, there may be an increase in Robusta demand over Arabica in future. Some of the major importing nations are the leading developing nation, notably the US, the EU and Japan, where the coffee beverage is very popular.</p>
          <h3>Issues Impacting Demand</h3>
					
					<p>Accordingly, issues which impact upon demand from these nations may have an effect on the markets. Coffee is harvested yearly in the dry season. In the largest coffee producing nation, Brazil, you need to be aware of the impact of frost and drought which can afflict the crop.</p>
					
                    <p>Frost particularly impacts the crop in the summer months, or the southern hemisphere’s winter however the occurrence tends to be limited to once every five years. In light of Robusta, you need to pay attention to factors affecting weather and general supply in Vietnam.</p>

                    <p>You need to be aware of reports produced by the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service, notably the bi-annual Coffee: World Markets and Trade report. Be aware of news emanating from the International Coffee Organization the most prominent intergovernmental coffee organization. The provide updates on the outlook of global coffee production.</p>
           <h3>Sugar</h3>
					
					<p>Sugar is a major crop in the soft’s complex. It is extracted from two notable sources. Two main types of sugar produced are from sugarcane, which accounts for around 70% of all sugar, and sugar beet, which accounts for the remaining 30%, based on an average over 30 years.</p>

				<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
					<p>Sugar derived from sugarcane is more popular than sugar beet. This is because it is cheaper to produce sugar from sugarcane than sugar beet. Sugar is typically used for human consumption as food, as it is the most popular form of sweetener and also a preservative.</p>

                    <p>There are other uses for both the sugarcane and sugar beet crop. The sugar pulp can be used for the purposes of feed for livestock.</p>

                    <p>One notable use of sugar can be for the production of ethanol. Brazil is the leading producer of sugar based ethanol. The production of sugar for ethanol typically means that there is another reason for demand. This in turn may impact upon the sugar market, given the impact factors like this may have on supply, so it’s important for you to be aware of this.</p>

					<h3>Largest Producers, Importers & Exporters</h3>
					
					<p>The world’s largest producers of sugar are Brazil, China, the EU and India. These four nations account for around half of all sugar produced in the world. Whilst most of those nations produce sugar from sugarcane, the sugar produced in EU predominantly comes from sugar beet.</p>

                    <p>An important factor on the price of sugar in the world market is the dump market. Brazil often produces more sugar than their domestic consumption requires.</p>

                    <p>The excess sugar produced by Brazil will make its way to the dump market, where a nation like Brazil will dump sugar onto the world market potentially for an excessively low price. This impacts the world market given the higher levels of supply and the downward pressure this can put on prices.</p>

                    <p>Although it is not one of the biggest producers, Thailand is one of the largest exporting nations so it is important to be aware of factors which can affect its supply.</p>

                    <p>In terms of world consumption and demand, typically, major established economies such as the EU and the US are the largest consuming nations, and regions of sugar. However, it is important for you to take into account the effect of demand for emerging markets and economies notably India, China, and Brazil.</p>

                    <p>Also the movement in small part, from conventional crude oil based energy to bio fuels has seen the popularity of oil alternative, like blended ethanol, increase. In terms of fundamental data sources for sugar, one of the most important for sugar is the Sugar World Markets and Trade Report, produced bi-annually by the United States Department of Agriculture.</p>

                    <p>This report provides supply and demand estimates for sugar emanating from the major producing nations namely Brazil.</p>

					<h3>Cotton</h3>
					
					<p>Cotton is a fiber seed, produced from the cotton plant. Cotton fiber is separated from the cotton seed through a process called ginning. There are a number of cotton species which are grown in different parts of the world.</p>

                    <p>Upland cotton is the species most commonly produced in the world. Other forms include Asiatic, Egyptian, American Pima and Sea Island cotton. From the cotton plant, cottonseed is also derived. Cottonseed oil is edible oil processed from cotton seed.</p>

                    <p>Cotton is predominantly produced in the tropical and subtropical regions. The major use for cotton is in textiles. The major producers of cotton are the US, China, India and Pakistan. These nations account for in excess of two thirds of the world’s cotton production.</p>

                    <p>Whilst the US have been the largest producer in the world, it is important to note the increase in cotton production in India, which has seen its cotton production rise to challenge the US.</p>

                    <p>This is coupled with the increase US acreage for the growth of some of the more popular grains; corn, wheat and soybeans.</p>

                    <p>Whilst the four nations mentioned are the biggest producers however, some of these very nations themselves provide significant domestic demand for their own produce with textile factories based within these nations are buying up cotton and selling on the manufactured articles abroad, mainly to the US.</p>

                    <p>This is why it is crucial for you to be aware of some of the smaller producers who have a larger impact on the export markets, such as Uzbekistan and Brazil. With that being said it should be noted that the United States are the largest export of cotton, with China being the largest importers of the crop.</p>

                    <p>Some of the main reports for you to look out for include the Cotton and Wool outlook, published by the USDA’s Economic Research Service.</p>
