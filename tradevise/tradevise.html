					 <h3 class="spoiler-title">What is the Difference Between Investing & Trading?</h3>
						<div class="spoiler-body">
            <p>Investing and trading are two different ways that we can profit from the financial markets. Many people new to the world of finance can be confused over what is the difference between the two. Here we will describe what we mean for each.</p>
            </div>
            </div>

           <h3 class="spoiler-title">Investing</h3>
						<div class="spoiler-body">
					  <p>The aim of an investor is to gradually build up their net worth by buying and holding a portfolio of stocks, bonds, mutual funds or other investable instruments.</p>

            <p>Investments are often held for years or even decades. Investors take advantage of certain perks such as dividend payments, coupon payments and/or interest during this time. When the markets fall in value, many investors will hold on to their investment in the expectation that the price will rebound. Investors are therefore looking at the long-term value of their investment and aren’t too concerned with the day to day volatility in the market.</p>

            <p>Investors take physical ownership of the instruments they have purchased. So for example, if an investor buys shares in a company they will physically own a portion of that company and will receive a certificate of ownership. A shareholder can carry certain privileges such as voting rights on certain corporate actions, as well as benefit from dividend payments on the profits…</p>

					<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
           <h3 class="spoiler-title">Trading</h3>
					<div class="spoiler-body">
					<p>Trading, on the other hand, is the more frequent buying and selling of financial instruments with the aim of outperforming buy-and-hold investments. There is no ownership of the underlying asset so traders are merely speculating on the price movement.</p>

          <p>Traders can therefore profit from falling markets as well as rising ones. A trader can buy an asset just like an investor but traders also have the ability to sell an instrument without owning it. This is known as short selling and is why many people are particularly attracted to trading. It is a key concept to understand and is a major reason why traders can outperform buy-and-hold investors. (We will discuss buying and selling in greater detail later.)</p>

          <p>While investors are often satisfied with annual returns of up to 15% depending on the risk element of the investment, some traders seek to make returns that are a multiple of this, as they can benefit from the dips in the market as well as the increases because of the ability to short sell.</p>

          <p>The length of time a trader has a position open for can range from seconds to years. This timeframe is entirely up to them and relates to their objectives, account size, risk profile and time they can commit to trading. Trading requires a more hands on approach than investing and regular assessment of market conditions is essential when traders have open positions.</p>

          <h3 class="spoiler-title">What Can We Trade?</h3>
					<div class="spoiler-body">
					<p>A financial instrument is a tradable asset of any kind i.e. it is an asset we can buy or sell at a monetary value on a financial market.</p>

          <p>Examples of financial instruments include currency pairs (i.e. the foreign exchange/FX market),commodities, stock indices and the stock of companies (also known as individual equities).</p>

          <p>As we do not take ownership of these assets when we are trading we are actually speculating on the price of futures contracts for FX instruments and Contracts for Difference (CFDs) for shares, commodities and stock indices. The price of these contracts is directly related to the price of the underlying instrument. So any movement in price of the physical asset will see a similar move in the price of the contract.</p>

          <p>The reason we trade futures contracts and CFDs is mainly due to the ease at which they can be traded and their cost-effective nature. For example if we physically owned a share in a company we may be liable for additional costs such as stamp duty in certain countries. There is no such cost with futures contracts and CFDs (We will discuss the costs associated with them later). CFDs can also be sold short. This is something that other types of instruments are prohibited from doing.</p>

          <p>We mentioned short selling several times in our first article so let’s further discuss the two ways we can trade a financial instrument.</p>
          </div>
          </div>
					<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
          <h3 class="spoiler-title">Selling Short</h3>
					<div class="spoiler-body">
					<p>The term ‘selling-short’ or ‘short-selling’ often confuses many new traders. Short selling allows traders to benefit from a fall in the market value of an instrument. But how can we sell an asset we do not own? We borrow it.</p>
					</div>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
					<h3 class="spoiler-title">Buying Long</h3>
					<div class="spoiler-body">
					<p>In traders’ jargon when we want to buy an instrument it is called ‘going long’. Going long is a concept all new traders should be familiar with. We’ve all heard the phrase ‘buy low & sell high’. That is exactly what we are doing. By buying or going long we want that instrument to rise in value. So if we buy 1 share for $5 and we sell it for $6 we have made a profit of $1 – simple.</p>

          <p>The easiest way to explain is with an example:</p>

          <p>So say Apple stock is currently trading at $500 per share and we believe that the price of Apple stock is likely to decline in the future to say $400 per share. We would like to profit from this fall in value and are willing to short sell 1 share so we can make $100 on this trade if it falls to this level.</p>

          <p>Say John owns one share of Apple and is happy to hold on to this share as he is a long-term investor or he believes it will rise in value. We approach John and ask him can we borrow his one share and we will give it back to him at a later date. He agrees.</p>

          <p>We instantly sell the share we have taken from John at the current market price of $500. Sure enough, we were right and the price of Apple fell the next week to $400 per share. Now we can buy back the one share of Apple we sold for $500 for the new price of $400. We can give John back his share and we can keep the $100 profit we made.</p>

          <p>Now you may be thinking that is a complicated process for a beginner trader. But as we are trading CFDs and futures contracts it is made as simple as possible. We do not have to find someone on the other side of the transaction (i.e. John) to lend us his share. Our broker will arrange that for us hassle-free and all we have to do is click on the SELL button if we believe the instrument will fall in value and alternatively click the BUY button if we believe it will rise in value.</p>
